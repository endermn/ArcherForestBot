Every 1,000 meters in depth, the player will have a chance (NOT 100%) to get a bow.

It cycles between 3 different bow grades from 1 star to 3 star. To further explain, here's data from two separate players mines:

Player 1:
Depth 1000m = 1 star bow
Depth 2000m = 2 star bow
Depth 3000m = no bow
Depth 4000m = 3 star bow
Depth 5000m = 1 star bow
Depth 6000m = no bow

Player 2:
Depth 1000m = 1 star bow
Depth 2000m = 2 star bow
Depth 3000m = 3 star bow
Depth 4000m = no bow
